	shorttitle = {The enclosure of movement},
	abstract = {"The Enclosure of Movement" explores the historical relationship between early modern state-building and the channelling of inter-polity mobility. Few historical settings offer a more illuminating prospect on this problem than the Holy Roman Empire, a variably integrated array of more than three-hundred quasi-sovereign polities between the Alps and the North Sea. The movements of goods and people through this fragmented political landscape engendered countless conflict-fraught encounters between travellers, local communities and the deputies of several hundred rulers. In the Old Reich, the politics of mobility were frequently framed in terms of 'safe-conduct', the quasi-sovereign right to escort travellers and to levy customs duties on passing goods and people. Based on manuscript, printed and visual sources from the late sixteenth to the early eighteenth centuries, collected in more than twenty archives, I survey interactions between state deputies, mobile populations and other stakeholders, reconstructing how passage and obstruction were negotiated at ground level. Detailed studies explore contentious processions, boundary disputes, techniques to channel mobility, self-serving orders of movement resting on ambiguous forms of protection, as well as seminal ideological debates around freedom of movement and its restriction. The study contributes to a better understanding of the politics of mobility in the Holy Roman Empire and broader accounts of state-building in at least three ways. First, I show that borders were not a privileged site for controlling inter-polity mobility, which challenges conventional conceptions and visualisation of pre-modern statehood. Second, I unearth debates around freedom of movement and its restriction that gave rise to concepts and arguments still in circulation today. Third, I propose a new way of historicizing the politics of mobility and offer a more complex, agency-oriented and open-ended account of how modern statehood gave rise to a contentious regime of movement.},

With this project we will develop our most successful visualization techniques to serve historical research with three user groups in mind: 1. Digital humanities scholars with the technical expertise to integrate our code into their own projects and web applications (the "widget" model); 2. Scholars seeking easy upload, exploration, and analysis of historical data sets, without having to touch any code; 3.

It begins with an introduction that defines {DH}, considers how {DH} can assist the way in which we think about tourism, and discusses the strengths and limitations of applications like text mining and digital mapping. This is followed by a review of the scholarship on digital mapping and the humanities which also highlights some of the important themes and projects that have sprung from this dynamic interdisciplinary dialogue. The latter half of the symposium is dedicated to two project reports. The first describes how the Grand Tour Project at Stanford University is utilizing a database of digital entries which combine digitised text and structured data to illuminate connections between eighteenth-century travellers. The second discusses how the Geospatial Innovation in the Digital Humanities project at Lancaster University is using geo-spatial technologies to examine the relationship between historically evolving ideas about tourist destinations in the Lake District and the contemporary management of such sites. The symposium concludes with some contemplation of the future developments in the realm of digital humanities and tourism history.},

	shorttitle = {The King's best highway},
	abstract = {This book is a look at  American history through the prism of the country's most storied highway, the Boston Post Road. It is based on extensive travels of the highway, interviews with people living up and down the road, and primary sources unearthed from the great libraries between New York City and Boston, including letters, maps, contemporaneous newspapers, and long forgotten government documents. During its evolution from Indian trails to modern interstates, the Boston Post Road, a system of over land routes between New York City and Boston, has carried not just travelers and mail but the march of American history itself. The author captures the progress of people and culture along the road through four centuries, from its earliest days as the king of England's "best highway" to the current era. Centuries before the telephone, radio, or Internet, the Boston Post Road was the primary conduit of America's prosperity and growth. News, rumor, political intrigue, financial transactions, and personal missives traveled with increasing rapidity, as did people from every walk of life.  From post riders bearing the alarms of revolution, to coaches carrying George Washington on his first presidential tour, to railroads transporting soldiers to the Civil War, the Boston Post Road has been essential to the political, economic, and social development of the United States.  Continuously raised, improved, rerouted, and widened for faster and heavier traffic, the road played a key role in the advent of newspapers, stagecoach travel, textiles, mass produced bicycles and guns, commuter railroads, automobiles, even Manhattan's modern grid. Many famous Americans traveled the highway, and it drew the keen attention of such diverse personages as Benjamin Franklin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, P.T. Barnum, J.P. Morgan, and Robert Moses. The author weaves this narrative with a historian's eye for detail and a journalist's flair for storytelling.  A cast of historical figures, celebrated and unknown alike, tells the lost tale of this road. Revolutionary printer William Goddard created a postal network that united the colonies against the throne. General Washington struggled to hold the highway during the battle for Manhattan. Levi Pease convinced Americans to travel by stagecoach until, half a century later, Nathan Hale convinced them to go by train. Abe Lincoln, still a dark horse candidate in early 1860, embarked on a railroad speaking tour along the route that clinched the presidency. Bomb builder Lester Barlow, inspired by the Post Road's notorious traffic, nearly sold Congress on a national system of expressways twenty five years before the Interstate Highway Act of 1956.},

	abstract = {Roads to Power tells the story of how Britain built the first nation connected by infrastructure, how a libertarian revolution destroyed a national economy, and how technology caused strangers to stop speaking. In early eighteenth-century Britain, nothing but dirt track ran between most towns. By 1848 the primitive roads were transformed into a network of highways connecting every village and island in the nation--and also dividing them in unforeseen ways. The highway network led to contests for control over everything from road management to market access. Peripheries like the Highlands demanded that centralized government pay for roads they could not afford, while English counties wanted to be spared the cost of underwriting roads to Scotland. The new network also transformed social relationships. Although travelers moved along the same routes, they occupied increasingly isolated spheres. The roads were the product of a new form of government, the infrastructure state, marked by the unprecedented control bureaucrats wielded over decisions relating to everyday life. Does information really work to unite strangers? Do markets unite nations and peoples in common interests? There are lessons here for all who would end poverty or design their markets around the principle of participation. Jo Guldi draws direct connections between traditional infrastructure and the contemporary collapse of the American Rust Belt, the decline of American infrastructure, the digital divide, and net neutrality. In the modern world, infrastructure is our principal tool for forging new communities, but it cannot outlast the control of governance by visionaries.--Book jacket.},

The article also uses a large number of postal endorsements to measure objectively the speed and efficiency of the Tudor south-west's royal post-stage service. In doing so, the study's primary goal is to demonstrate that this mode of government dispatch was more rapid and reliable than the majority of historians, who have relied on anecdotal subjective evidence, recognize.},

That August he set off on a remarkable, occasionally hazardous, four-year voyage to Syria, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and the Portuguese colonies of western India. His journal, now translated into English for the first time, is the most important new European travel account of western Asia to be published in the past hundred years. It opens an extraordinary perspective on the Near East and India at a time when few Europeans traveled to these lands. Keenly observed and engagingly written, Bembo's vivid account is filled with a high sense of adventure and curiosity and provides intriguing descriptions of people, landscapes, food, fashion, architecture, customs, cities, commerce, and more. Presented here with the original illustrations and with a rich introduction and annotations, this lively and important historical document is at last available to scholars, students, and armchair travelers alike.

Compiled from the celebrated archive accumulated by Sir Brinsley Ford, this volume provides brief formal biographies of these travellers, their Italian itineraries and selective accounts of their experiences as described in contemporary sources. While the majority of travellers were young persons making the grand tour - discovering antiquity, the temptations of a brisk and irregular art market, the squalor and the riches of Italian life and travel - there were also many older visitors intent on some professional purpose, including prison reformer John Howard, agronomist Arthur Young and musicologist Charles Burney. Over three hundred artists, sculptors and architects made the trip. The dictionary includes British antiquaries who became guides or art dealers in Rome or Naples, among them Mark Parker, Thomas Jenkins and Colin Morison. There were those who sought a warmer climate for their health; disconsolate Jacobites gathered round the exiled Stuart court in Rome as well as unsettled eccentrics, bankrupts and misfits.},

	abstract = {Individuals engaged in overseas trade in the early modern period often faced high levels of uncertainty regarding their prospects for trade. One way of managing uncertainty is to gather information from others through social interactions, that is, through social networks. Here we consider how social ties impacted trade patterns by analyzing the relationship between port traffic and early modern ship captains’ exposure to information about ports using informal relations. We consider the possible impact of strong and weak ties and the use of ties under different types of uncertainty. The analysis suggests that social networks encouraged trade at port cities with already high rates of traffic, though this effect is less pronounced than for other means through which information was distributed throughout the trade system.},
